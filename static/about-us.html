<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Tweet Creep: A Spatially- and Temporally-aware Collaborative Recommender System</h1>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Have you ever wondered who's tweeting around you? Have you wondered where they've been, or where they might be going? Where should you go to be at the center of attention? Tweet Creep answers these questions by geolocating Twitter users and content.
</div>
</p>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Basic Features</h2>
<p>
Tweet Creep fetches tweets from within a certain radius of a user-specified location. These tweets, identified by colored pins, are plotted and connected on a Google map, allowing the user to identify Twitter user movement patterns.
Additionally, users may submit a specific Twitter handle to retrieve a particular Twitter user's location history.
</div>
</p>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Recommender</h2>
<p>
Tweet Creep identifies the center of Twitter activity and recommends where you should go to be at the center of attention.
Up to 50 unique Twitter users are identified within a radius of a user-specified location. The recent Tweet history of each user is retrieved, plotted, and averaged to collaboratively determine the center of activity. The recommender gives different results for every unique location center (spatially aware). Every recommendation is based on real-time data (temporally aware).
</div>
</p>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Interface</h2>
<p>
Tweet Creep provides an easy to use interface that allows users to quickly snap to a articular user, view Tweet content, and travel to an identified users' external Twitter page.
</div>
</p>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Implementation</h2>
<p>
Tweet Creep is implemented in Python + HTML + Javascript and hosted by Google App Engine. Twitter and Google Maps API access is provided by Tweepy and GoogleMaps API V3, respectively.
