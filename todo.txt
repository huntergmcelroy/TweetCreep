to do:

1. FIX GEOLOCATION IN SERVER
2. Remove unused packages
	json?
	urllib
	urlfetch
3. scrollbar for user button sidebar
<done> Speed this shit up! <it's very fast on the server>
<done> Search results -> buttons move map to user tweets on map
3. Search for user - done, but need to catch when twitter user doesn't have any tweets or the query is invalid
4. map behaviors - need to work on zoom, usability


error/invalid input catching:

if no input for all forms
if twitter call returns nothing
if twitter call returns no geolocation data for user



by Monday, Dec 2:

if user only has one tweet - ignore them
result buttons move to user's tweets
map zoom?
